# What is ulysses?
**ulysses** is only a small piece of a much larger puzzle: **The Union**.  
Simply put, I wanted to make my own little army of scripts to run with simple, yet effective, commands. Naming this new-found idea, however, was very challenging.  
After mulling around with some ideas for a bit, I decided that the name this repo would recieve would be the name of the "master" program (or, rather, the script which would control all of its contents).  
With that idea in mind, I simply chose an army with a general whose name sounded cool. That's where **ulysses** came from, as I found the leader of the Union army in the American Civil War to have a very cool name (with spelling just difficult enough to make sure my program would be unique).  
Well enough about that, let's get you acquainted with your new army!
