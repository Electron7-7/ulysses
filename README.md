# What is ulysses?
**ulysses** is only a small piece of a much larger puzzle: **The Union**.  
Simply put, I wanted to make my own little army of scripts to run with simple, yet effective, commands. Naming this new-found idea, however, was very challenging.  
After mulling around with some ideas for a bit, I decided that the name this repo would recieve would be the name of the "master" program (or, rather, the script which would control all of its contents).  
With that idea in mind, I simply chose an army with a general whose name sounded cool. That's where **ulysses** came from, as I found the leader of the Union army in the American Civil War to have a very cool name (with spelling just difficult enough to make sure my program would be unique).  
With that out of the way, the real focus of this markdown file should be...

# The Union 
**The Union** is a repo filled with random scripts I create, all of them controlled by **ulysses** of course.  
To get you acquainted with your new soldiers I have provided the following list of every single script's grouping, name, and a brief description.  
Have fun!

## General 
- **newhup:** a script designed to make using `nohup` cleaner, simpler, and prettier
- **spoofme** a quick and simple way to randomize the last four characters of any network interface's MAC address
- **whatsmymac** quickly see the current MAC address of a specific network interface
